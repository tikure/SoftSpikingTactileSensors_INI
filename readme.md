# SoftSpikingTactileSensors_INI
Semester Project at INI UZH, spiking implementation of reskin soft tactile sensor on neuromorphic hardware

Project by Timothy Kurer, Supervised by Elisa Donati, sensor based on reskin.dev.

The sense of touch is extremely important for both humans and robots alike to accurately gauge
their interaction with their environment. Advanced tactile sensing is essential for robotic dexterous
manipulation of objects and thus important for sensory feedback in neuro-prosthetic applications.
Yet development of tactile sensing in robotic applications lags behind vision and audition.

The goal of this project is to construct an already developed soft sensor, such as ReSkin,
integrate it with the prosthetic hand Mia and convert its output into a spike based input for
a neuromorphic chip. Spike based encoding would allow integration to existing neuromorphic
hardware utilized for control of the prosthetic hand as well as allowing for higher resolution at lower
power consumption.
